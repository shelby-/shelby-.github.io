Ugly Mug,U District,2,2,4,3,2,3,I remember this place having odd hours in the past. I've only been there once or twice. It is cramped inside. Kind of the worst of all worlds for working on socializing.,
A Muddy Cup,Wallingford,3,2,5,4,5,2,Super cozy little spot worth checking out. The owners are a couple that have put a lot of work into the place.
